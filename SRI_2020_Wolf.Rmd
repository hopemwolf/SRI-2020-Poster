## Background

* A **short cervix** in the midtrimester is a **powerful predictor** of spontaneous preterm delivery.

* The **rate of change** in cervical length is also associated with increased risk for sPTD, **independent** of the baseline measurement. 

* How much of the **variation** in cervical length and cervical shortening is attributable to **genetic factors**?

* Do the **same genes** influence **cervical change** and **gestational age** at delivery?


## Methods

* Cervical change across pregnancy modeled as a **latent growth curve** in MPlus.

* Longitudinal cervical length data from **>5,000** women with a singleton pregnancy

* Cervical length measured via TVU and gestational age at delivery measured from LMP and confirmed by ultrasound

## Conceptual Model

```{r, eval = TRUE, overlap-fig, out.width = "90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Proposal_Aims.jpg")
```


## Discussion

* Estimate the **genetic contribution** to cervical change and its role **mediating** timing of birth

* Understand the **pathophysiology** of a **short cervix** and its association with sPTB
